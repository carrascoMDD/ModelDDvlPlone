ModelDDvlPlone RELEASE NOTES
============================

|
|

Summary of use cases implemented after delivery of version 1.0 (build200907160507)
==================================================================================

- Paste copies of elements. Paste identical copies when possible, or refactor into a type appropriate for the container.
  For example, in the gvSIGbpd application, 
  pasting a Business Rule, in a Collection of Business Rules shall yield a new Business Rule,
  yet pasting it into a Business Policies Collection shall yield a new Business Policy.

- Export an element as .zip archives with information in a character encoded (utf8) .xml file, 
  and plone binary content as separate files.

- Import into an element as .zip archives with .xml file and binary content.

- Audit information is recorded on elements as the user and date/time of creation, modification and deletion.
  There is an still unused feature to avoid truly deleting elements,
  but leave them flagged as deleted.
  
- Copy/Cut/Delete multiple aggregated elements.
  The user interface for collections now presents to the user
  check boxes to select elements to which an action shall apply,
  and a menu to triger the action.
  
- Move elements to a different collection by Cut/Paste.

- New link to refresh the Tabular and Textual views.

- Standard Plone actions and factories are intercepted or aliased
  to maintain a tight model driven control on the application information.
  
- The Id of an element can be edited in the element editor,
  with the field protected with an additional button
  that the user shall click to gain edit access to de Id field.
  
- Create a new Version as a copy of a whole model, 
  maintaining traceability links from elements in the new version 
  to elements in the previous version.  
  
- Process steps now can record effort estimations, and timing constraints.
