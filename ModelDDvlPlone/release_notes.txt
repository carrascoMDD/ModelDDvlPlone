20091229

Separated persistent configuration to a different product ModelDDvlPloneConfiguration, new in this revision.
Allow to hot-reload all modules by invoking the MDDReload view by users with Manage portal permissions.
Extended the accelerated rendering of Tabular view, to accept overrides of the different rendering handlers for specific sections of the page, and insert additional behaviour between the main sections of the rendering. Extensions can be to invoke a template or script (whose rendered result is inserted in the page), or to invoke a external method.
Also, to evaluate an expression (whose result is inserted in the page), or execute an expression.
Clean up of obsolete files.

Summary of use cases implemented after delivery of version 1.0 (build200907160507)
==================================================================================

- Cache rendered pages for Textual and Tabular views,
  and invalidate the cached entries 
  upon changes on the elements or elements the page depends on.
  
- Intercept standard Plone actions to avoid undesired manipulations of the elements.

- Export can be configured to deliver a minimum of content
  in a XML file that can be compared with previous exports
  and raise no differences if the models contain the same information
  (a non-minimal export includes information elements that are unique to the exported instance).
  
- Reorder aggregated elements by drag&drop of rows in a table.

- Table of contents in Textual views.

- Hyperlinking  Formatting and Styling Changes in Textual View to improve readability an usability.

- Component Plone Products and versions are presented along with product Credits.



|
|


**Use Cases already reported as implemented after delivery of version 1.0 (build200907160507**

- Paste copies of elements. Paste identical copies when possible, or refactor into a type appropriate for the container.
  For example, in the gvSIGbpd application, 
  pasting a Business Rule, in a Collection of Business Rules shall yield a new Business Rule,
  yet pasting it into a Business Policies Collection shall yield a new Business Policy.

- Export an element as .zip archives with information in a character encoded (utf8) .xml file, 
  and plone binary content as separate files.

- Import into an element as .zip archives with .xml file and binary content.

- Audit information is recorded on elements as the user and date/time of creation, modification and deletion.
  There is an still unused feature to avoid truly deleting elements,
  but leave them flagged as deleted.
  
- Copy/Cut/Delete multiple aggregated elements.
  The user interface for collections now presents to the user
  check boxes to select elements to which an action shall apply,
  and a menu to triger the action.
  
- Move elements to a different collection by Cut/Paste.

- New link to refresh the Tabular and Textual views.

- Standard Plone actions and factories are intercepted or aliased
  to maintain a tight model driven control on the application information.
  
- The Id of an element can be edited in the element editor,
  with the field protected with an additional button
  that the user shall click to gain edit access to de Id field.
  
- Create a new Version as a copy of a whole model, 
  maintaining traceability links from elements in the new version 
  to elements in the previous version.  
  
- Process steps now can record effort estimations, and timing constraints.

- Allows to reorder by drag and drop all contained elements in an element
